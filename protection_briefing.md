## Media & News Coverage

### 1. Multiple Protesters Invade Reform Conference Announcing Doncaster Mayoral Candidate
- Reputational Concerns: The Reform’s press conference meant to introduce its mayoral candidate was disrupted by protesters. This may negatively impact the party's public image. The derogatory comments made by Nigel Farage ("boring" "loser" and "shouldn't you be working?") may also be considered unprofessional and could damage his and the party's reputation. (https://order-order.com/2025/03/25/multiple-protesters-invade-reform-conference-announcing-doncaster-mayoral-candidate/)
- Legal or political controversies: The protest that disrupted the Reform's press conference may generate political controversy concerning free speech and the rights of political parties to conduct their activities without interference. The response of Nigel Farage may also spark controversy due to the potentially derogatory nature of his comebacks.

## Breach Exposure (HIBP)

### 1. Adobe
- Type of data exposed: Internal ID, username, email, encrypted password and a password hint in plain text.
- Reputational or Security risk: This breach carries a high security risk for the subject. Even though the passwords were encrypted, the poor cryptography made them easily resolvable back to plain text. Furthermore, password hints were given in plain text, potentially revealing even more about the user's password and hence increasing the risk of unauthorized access to other accounts that use the same or similar passwords. The subject could potentially have all accounts associated with this email compromised, especially if they reused passwords or made them predictable based on the hint provided.
- Severity of the breach: High. The Adobe breach in 2013 is considered one of the biggest data breaches ever due to the number of accounts affected and the type of data exposed. The poor password encryption and plain text hints have exacerbated the potential risks associated with this breach.
